# Specification Quality Checklist: Statistics Ingestion Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist criteria were reviewed against the canonical specification. The spec names existing contracts and ownership boundaries to keep behavior aligned; it does not prescribe a new framework, interface, or persistence design.
- TASK-020 position optionality is a planning prerequisite recorded in the spec and product handoff; its resolution must preserve already accepted facts.
- This checklist validates specification quality only; it is not independent product challenge, implementation evidence, QA, or final review.
